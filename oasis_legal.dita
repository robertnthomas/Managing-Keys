		<p>OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) is a
			not-for-profit, international consortium that drives the development, convergence, and
			adoption of e-business standards. Members themselves set the OASIS technical agenda,
			using a lightweight, open process expressly designed to promote industry consensus and
			unite disparate efforts. The consortium produces open standards for Web services,
			security, e-business, and standardization efforts in the public sector and for
			application-specific markets. OASIS was founded in 1993. More information can be found
			on the OASIS website at http://www.oasis-open.org.</p>
		<p>The OASIS DITA Adoption Technical Committee members collaborate to provide expertise and
			resources to educate the marketplace on the value of the DITA OASIS standard. By raising
			awareness of the benefits offered by DITA, the DITA Adoption Technical Committee expects
			the demand for, and availability of, DITA conforming products and services to increase,
			resulting in a greater choice of tools and platforms and an expanded DITA community of
			users, suppliers, and consultants.</p>
